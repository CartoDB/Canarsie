![img](brooklyn-network.png) (image is of old version)

Earlier last week, news came out that the MTA was considering how to repair damages to the tunnel used by the L train to connect Manhattan and Brooklyn. The damages were caused by flooding during Hurricane Sandy and their repair may have big consequences to L train riders in the near future. As the MTA weighs the options, which include a full closing of the L train during repairs, or a longer period with weekend only closures, CartoDB wanted to dig in and look at what L train disruption looked like to the population of Brooklyn. How many, what backgrounds, and what alternatives are out there for what may come to the L.

Even if you aren't from NYC you have heard of many of the neighborhoods that the L train serves, from Chelsea to Williamsburg and Bushwick. In recent years, it has been one of the fastest growing subway lines in terms of ridership, with just the Bedford Avenue stop in Williamsburg seeing [27,224 average weekday customers](http://www.mta.info/news-subway-new-york-city-transit/2015/04/20/subway-ridership-surges-26-one-year) back in 2014.

There is more to the L train than numbers alone. If you know people that live in Williamsburg and commute to Manhattan in the morning, you've probably heard the stories of morning commutes where only place to put your arms is on shoulders of the people sardined beside you. More than  that, the L train services.... [STUB IN AGE, INCOME, FAMILY SIZE]

### Who is using the L?

The MTA periodically releases data about [subway ridership](http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/) but knowing who those people are takes a bit more work.
